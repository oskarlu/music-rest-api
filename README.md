# Alt sources looked at

Had a super quick look at most of them and narrowed it down to three that I figured would have a bio of the artist and a good chance of having some kind of public api. Those were last.fm, Spotify and Google Play. Sadly they all required an account with them to get an access token to be able to use their apis. Last.fm even uses MBIDs so that would have been neat.
