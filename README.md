"Please add a README.md with detailed information about your solution. How do we build and run it? What tools did you use? Why did you use them? Did you intentionally leave stuff out or made any shortcuts? In that case, what and why? How and why did you select the source of the profile information (i.e. the source of your choice)?"


# Alt sources looked at

Had a super quick look at most of them and narrowed it down to three that I figured would have a bio of the artist and a good chance of having some kind of public api. Those were last.fm, Spotify and Google Play. Sadly they all required an account with them to get an access token to be able to use their apis. Last.fm even uses MBIDs so that would have been neat.
